Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAbridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAbridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do.

We believe that, in order to have a realistically manageable vulnerability surface, all modern applications need end-to-end guarantees of data integrity and authenticity. The only way to build secure and private applications is to remove unnecessary implicit trust in network boundaries, intermediaries and infrastructure.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eThe Ockam team is passionate about making powerful cryptographic protocols simple and safe for application developers.

Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Team:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigning a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing, and a platform for businesses to reach our audience requires a multidisciplinary approach.

As a result, about 80 thousand tests run before integrating a change into the main branch and 40 thousand builds run every week on our CI system.  This presents a big engineering challenge on its own and requires a sophisticated infrastructure using hundreds of build agents, including dynamically added capacity with AWS, and a Kubernetes cluster for test distribution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about how the Gradle Build Tool project is built, see also the interview with Stefan Wolf, the current leader of our Developer Productivity Team at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MSxJPhr4Eo\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MSxJPhr4Eo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eResponsibilities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eHelping a growing team of 20+ engineers to improve their productivity\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eLeading a small team of developer productivity engineers\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eOptimizing a large Gradle build at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/gradle/gradle\"\u003ehttps://github.com/gradle/gradle\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eOptimizing a CI pipeline at \u003ca href=\"https://builds.gradle.org/\"\u003ehttps://builds.gradle.org/\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eDesigning and implementing Gradle plugins\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eDesigning and implementing bots integrating with various systems such as GitHub\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eImplementing and improving monitoring of developer productivity metrics\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eOrganizing processes and helping to eliminate frequent errors and flaky tests\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMinimum qualifications\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e5 years of software development or developer productivity engineering experience\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eTeam leadership experience\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExperience developing and maintaining non-trivial Gradle builds\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExperience with CI/CD and configuration management systems\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExperience programming in Java, Kotlin, or Groovy\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAbility to troubleshoot build issues and flaky tests\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding of modern software development techniques and practices\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eWorking proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePreferred qualifications\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExperience with Linux, macOS and Windows administration\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExperience with configuration management systems such as Ansible\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat we value\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ePassion for making other software engineers more productive\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eDelivering useful high-quality solutions \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ePragmatism in execution and getting things done\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eOpen communication and respect for each other\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat we offer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eWorking with cutting edge developer productivity engineering tools and practices\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eCooperation with passionate and experienced engineers and the opportunity to learn from them regardless of your experience level\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAbility to work from any place on the planet in a remote-first environment with flexible working hours\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eOpportunities for growth in technical and leadership responsibilities\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAttractive compensation package including company equity\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLocation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnywhere in the world with working conditions that allow for seamless collaboration with your colleagues through email, chat, and video streaming\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our team works remotely and is spread across the globe, we deeply value daily interactions and collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow to apply\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following is required with your application:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSubmit your cover letter, answers to our application questions and resume via the form below\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next steps will follow \u003ca href=\"https://gradle.com/recruitment-process/\"\u003eour recruitment process\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout us\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are committed and skilled software engineers, product designers, and marketing experts who are passionate about developer productivity.

Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbridge is an equal opportunity employer.

Have you ever found a new favourite series on Netflix, picked up groceries curbside at Walmart, or paid for something using Square? That’s the power of data in motion in action—giving organisations instant access to the massive amounts of data that is constantly flowing throughout their business. At Confluent, we’re building the foundational platform for this new paradigm of data infrastructure. Our cloud-native offering is designed to be the intelligent connective tissue enabling real-time data, from multiple sources, to constantly stream across the organisation. With Confluent, organisations can create a central nervous system to innovate and win in a digital-first world.\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eWe’re looking for self-motivated team members who crave a challenge and feel energised to roll up their sleeves and help realise Confluent’s enormous potential.

Have you ever found a new favourite series on Netflix, picked up groceries curbside at Walmart, or paid for something using Square? That’s the power of data in motion in action—giving organisations instant access to the massive amounts of data that is constantly flowing throughout their business. At Confluent, we’re building the foundational platform for this new paradigm of data infrastructure. Our cloud-native offering is designed to be the intelligent connective tissue enabling real-time data, from multiple sources, to constantly stream across the organisation. With Confluent, organisations can create a central nervous system to innovate and win in a digital-first world.\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eWe’re looking for self-motivated team members who crave a challenge and feel energised to roll up their sleeves and help realise Confluent’s enormous potential. Chart your own path and take healthy risks as we solve big problems together. We value having diverse teams and want you to grow as we grow—whether you’re just starting out in your career or managing a large team, you’ll be amazed at the magnitude of your impact.\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout The Role\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eDid you ever have one of those teachers in a school who captured your imagination, unwrapping the satisfaction of an equation or the hidden meaning behind classical prose? At Confluent this is what teaching is about, imparting the excitement of new technology, the insights and trade-offs you need to build reliable systems and the pervasive idea that data-in-motion is as important as data at rest in the software systems of our future. As a Technical Instructional Designer, you will do all of this by building high-profile, deeply technical training. Training like \u003ca href=\"https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/events/\" class=\"postings-link\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/event-sourcing/event-driven-vs-state-based/\" class=\"postings-link\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/inside-ksqldb/streaming-architecture/\" class=\"postings-link\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eSo, what are we looking for? The role will suit someone with a technical practitioner background: you may have previously worked as an application developer or data engineer. This background will help you understand technical subject matter in context, and frame it for today's practitioners. You’ll also be good at distilling these subjects down to suit today’s appetite for shorter-form content. Most of all, you’ll know how to craft and tell a compelling story, something we believe is vital for capturing the imagination of your audience.

However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients.

We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that \"you need to taste good things to have good taste.\"\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv\u003eAbridge is an equal opportunity employer.
